	<h5>I'm a Biostatistics PhD student in my fifth year of study at UC Berkeley. My background is primarily in computer science, psychology, and brain imaging. My current research focuses on localized semi-parametric prediction, short-term health-related outcomes in trauma care patients, and the relationship between social media activity and trauma center patient load. Methodological topics of interest include machine learning, non-/semi-parametric estimation, causal inference, and data visualization. When I'm not working, I enjoy hiking, cooking, and spending time with my partner and our two dogs.</h5>
