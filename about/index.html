	<h5>I'm a Biostatistics PhD candidate in my final year of study at UC Berkeley. I received a BA in Computer Science and Psychology from Duke University and subsequently worked as a researcher in brain imaging labs at Duke and Emory. My current work focuses on machine learning methodology for prediction of adverse health-related outcomes in trauma patients, prediction of mass trauma events using social media data, data visualization, and statistical software package development. I also currently work as a part-time R developer at Genentech in South San Francisco. When I'm not working, I enjoy hiking, cooking, and spending time with my partner and our two dogs.</h5>
